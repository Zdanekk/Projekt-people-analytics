## Project Overview üí°
The Team Management project aims to enhance the management of project teams within the WAIT organization. WAIT is dedicated to executing projects in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science, and Business Intelligence (BI). By analyzing data regarding the competencies of team members, this project seeks to improve the processes involved in forming effective project teams. The overarching goal is to leverage data-driven insights to create well-balanced, high-performing teams.

## Business Context üßê
WAIT undertakes projects that address real business challenges, following the Passion Based Learning (PBL) methodology. This approach encourages learning and skill acquisition among individuals connected by common interests, who learn from one another.

## Problem to Solve ü§î
Currently, WAIT has data on the declared competencies of individuals willing to work on projects, but lacks insight into how these competencies are distributed and can be effectively utilized. 

### **```The project's challenge is to extract valuable insights from the collected data, which will aid in constructing efficient project teams.```**

## Machine Learning Methods
To achieve the objectives, the project will employ machine learning techniques, including clustering, to segment WAIT members. This analysis aims to:

üî∏ Identify distinct groups of users based on their competencies.

üî∏ Derive interesting insights about the structure and potential of the WAIT community.

## Project Goals
‚û°Ô∏è Verify the existence of distinguishable user groups within the WAIT community.

‚û°Ô∏è Analyze available data to provide valuable insights regarding the WAIT community.

‚û°Ô∏è Teach participants the basics of working on a Data Science project, emphasizing quality to ensure the final product can be added to their CVs as a public repository example.


### **``` This project is carried out by students eager to develop their skills in data analysis. ```**


## Project Description

‚û°Ô∏è The chapter [_"01_datapreprocessing"_](https://github.com/Zdanekk/Projekt-people-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/01_DataPreprocessing.ipynb) deals with the initial preprocessing of data from an Excel file related to a competency survey. The process begins by loading the data from the Excel file into a DataFrame object using the pd.read_excel function. Subsequently, the ID column is converted to a string type to ensure data consistency.

The style for plots is set using the seaborn library, enhancing the aesthetics of the visualizations. A heatmap is created to visualize the missing values in the data, helping to identify patterns of missing data and aiding in decision-making for further data processing. Then, unnecessary columns are removed from the dataset, and selected columns are renamed for easier handling.

Finally, the filtered and updated data is saved to a new CSV file, enabling further stages of data analysis. This process is crucial for preparing the data for more advanced analysis and modeling, ensuring that the data is complete, consistent, and easy to manage.

‚û°Ô∏è The chapter [_"02_featureengineering"_](https://github.com/Zdanekk/Projekt-people-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/02_FeatureEngineering.ipynb) focuses on preprocessing and filtering data for further analysis. The process begins by determining the current file path and the parent directory path using the pathlib library. The script then defines the input file path for the CSV file containing the selected features from the previous preprocessing step.

The data is loaded from this CSV file into a DataFrame using pandas. Specific values in the "Community Participation" column, which indicate non-contributory responses, are defined and removed from the dataset. The filtered data is then saved to a new CSV file in the specified output directory, ensuring that only relevant data is retained for further analysis.

Overall, this chapter ensures that the dataset is cleaned and filtered by removing irrelevant responses, making it ready for subsequent stages of analysis and modeling.

‚û°Ô∏è The chapter [_"03_ExploratoryDataAnalysis"_](https://github.com/Zdanekk/Projekt-people-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/03_ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb) focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the filtered dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights. The process begins with loading the processed data from a CSV file and setting the 'Participant ID' as the index. The script then selects numerical columns for correlation analysis and creates a triangular heatmap of Spearman correlations to visualize the relationships between numerical variables.

Next, unnecessary columns are removed, and the data is sorted based on the sum of values in each row. A heatmap of individual competencies is generated, displaying different levels of engagement and competency with a custom color legend. The chapter also includes calculating the mean rating for each skill, sorting the skills by their mean ratings, and creating a stacked bar plot to show the distribution of ratings for each skill.

Overall, this chapter involves cleaning and organizing the data, performing correlation analysis, and visualizing various aspects of the data to gain deeper insights into participant competencies and relationships between different skills.

‚û°Ô∏è The chapter [_"04_K-means"_](https://github.com/Zdanekk/Projekt-people-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/04_K-means.ipynb) focuses on clustering data using the k-means algorithm. The process begins by loading the filtered data from a CSV file and removing textual columns and the 'Participant ID' column. Next, the optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method, visualizing the inertia for different values of ùëò.

Based on the Elbow Method results, the optimal number of clusters is selected, and the k-means clustering algorithm is applied to group the data. The clustering results are validated using the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index. Additionally, the script prints the participant IDs assigned to each cluster and visualizes the correlation matrix for each cluster, helping to understand the relationships between variables within each cluster.

‚û°Ô∏è In the [_"05_hierarchical_testing"_](https://github.com/Zdanekk/Projekt-people-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/05_Hierchical_Testing.ipynb) chapter, the code performs a detailed hierarchical clustering analysis and visualizes the results using dendrograms. The process begins with importing essential libraries for file operations, data manipulation, numerical computations, hierarchical clustering, and plotting. It then determines the current file path and the parent directory path to construct the path to the input CSV file containing the data. Once the data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, the 'Participant ID' column is set as the index, and only numerical columns are selected for further analysis. The data is cleaned by replacing infinite values with NaN and then filling these NaN values with the mean of the respective columns. This ensures that there are no infinite or NaN values remaining in the dataset. The cleaned numerical data is then converted into a numpy array for clustering analysis.

The code defines various distance metrics and linkage methods for the clustering process. It calculates the number of valid plots based on these combinations, ensuring that the 'ward' method is only used with the 'euclidean' metric. Subplots are created to display the dendrograms for each valid metric-method combination. The dendrograms are generated using the linkage function to perform hierarchical clustering and the dendrogram function to visualize the results. Each subplot is titled according to the metric-method combination used. The code handles any potential errors during this process by printing an error message. Finally, the layout of the plots is adjusted to fit neatly on the canvas, and the dendrograms are displayed using plt.show().
